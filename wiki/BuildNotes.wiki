This page provides some notes how to download and build the project.

= Introduction =

All subprojects of _visualDependencies_ use the Java 6 SDK. The build management is done with Maven 2. The projects are built-with Eclipse ones, so Eclipse users will have no problems importing the project as a standard Java/Maven project.


= Details for Eclipse (recommended) =

Note: You have to install the [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/ m2eclipse] Plugin. This is the de-facto standard Maven-Plugin for Eclipse. This will provide a built-in Maven, too.

In Eclipse 3.6 (current release), import a new projekt using Eclipse's Import from SVN feature. For SVN information, see the tab [http://code.google.com/p/visualdependencies/source/list Source] at the top. 

That's it. Build a new jar artifact or just start the Main.java.

= Details for command line/no Build-Management-IDE =

Note: You have to install Maven2 and make it available in your path environment. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a full Maven install guide. 

Just checkout the code from the SVN. For SVN information, see the tab [http://code.google.com/p/visualdependencies/source/list Source] at the top. 

That's it. Build a new jar artifact via mvn package and start the jar.

= One-Jar =
Currently, the build process does not provide a onejar artifact. This will come later.
