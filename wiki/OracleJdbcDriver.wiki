The Oracle JDBC driver is not part of the project nor the oracle plugin. 

= Problem =
Due license issues, we cannot provide a built-in driver support. Because of this, Oracle provides no official maven dependency support for this jar files.

= Solution for "vdb-release-2009" =
You can download a suitable file at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/jdbc-10201-088211.html -- for example the ojdbc14.jar.

In order to build a jar file *with built-in oracle support*:
 # Make sure that the actual build was successful. The directory _target_ should contain at least the artifact project.jar (and project.one-jar.jar if the one-jar profile was active). 
 # Download a suitable ojdbc jar file and place it right into the target directory.
 # Perform the ant script at /src/main/scripts/build-with-ojdbc.xml. The default parameters require an ojdbc14.jar at /oracle/lib/ojdbc14.jar and the one-jar artifact.

So, in short:
 # Download and save the ojdbc14 at /oracle/lib/ojdbc14.jar
 # mvn clean package
 # ant -buildfile src/main/scripts/build-with-ojdbc.xml attachOJDBC
